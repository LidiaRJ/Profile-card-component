## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn about position objects and background images inside a container. This project helped me to have a better understanding of Flexbox and how to style elements. 


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on developing responsive desgins not only with Flexbox technology but also using the Grid layout and CSS Frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A great tool to learn how HTML tags work, to find elements you may need for your design and how to style them with CSS.
